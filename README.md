# Setup Instructions

1. Create a fork to the repo in your account. Any changes should be done here and send a pull request to merge your changes.

2. Open the project (cloned repo) in Android Studio. Run `flutter pub get` to get the updated dependencies (if any, also in case of a `git pull`).

3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `pubspec.yaml`. The contents of this file are in #frontend channel of discord. (This file contains sensitive information, hence it is not on GitHub)
